Are you sick of these decks that brainstorm twice every turn, generate infinite resources, then mill out and sit on their compression without any consequences? Have you ever wish that maybe Weiss is a bit more interactive, maybe bully your opponent a little and make them pay for being greedy? Well with this event focused Pixar deck you can that while also brainstorming every turn, gaining an obscene amount of resources, and milling out every turn. 

Usually events are tricky to play Weiss Schwarz because there are few ways to get them into hand other than drawing them for turn or using a combo that adds a specific event. Thankfully, the Toy Story 30th Anniversary set added more ways to dig for them and it also comes with new exciting events that either helps with consistency or allows us to bully the opponent.

## Overview

### The Lv1 Combo - Ducky and Bunny

[![Lv1 Ducky & Bunny](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_071.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-071) 
*On attack with CX, top-check to salvage the lvl shown or lower, then optional hand to stock, if the revealed card is an event then draw 1.*

This is the bread and butter of the deck and what everything is built around. There is a lot of effect text because it is kinda overpowered. Our level 1 combo is a conditional plus 2 hand that also lets us convert hand to gain up to 6 stock a turn. Generally, in Weiss Schwarz, generating 3 stock a turn is the baseline, so being able to gain more stock without having to swing with a different card like a stock-charge profile is a great bonus. The catch to fully utilizing this insane advantage combo is having to play a lot of events, which is a deck-building restriction. Oh, and it also requires 3 or more other characters, I guess.

While level 1 combos that pluses 2 is nothing new (such as [Chloe](https://en.ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=HOL/W104-E070), or more recently [Saki](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=GIM/W124-036a) and [Modernia](https://en.ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=NIK/S117-E059)) there is surprising flexibility in being able to choose between gaining more stock or hand. We can also choose what goes into stock and where it goes, which is very useful in the hands of a good player. A common drawback of these types of combos is poor card selection, however, since we don’t play any other level 1 or level 2 characters this drawback is much less noticeable. Another common issue is that the combo effect offers no mill on its own, but you’ll find that this won’t be a problem after seeing the rest of the deck.

### The Brainstorm
[![Lv0 Trixie Brainstorm](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_015.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-015) *On play ditch 1, search vanilla from deck. Brainstorm 6 if there's a vanilla, salvage per CX hit.* [![Lv0 Sparks Vanilla](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_058.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-058) 

What is better than brainstorm 4? Brainstorm 5. What is better than brainstorm 5? Tap-self brainstorm 6, salvage per generic CX hit. We've seen the rise of brainstorm 5 recently in 2024 and 2025, however, they are often locked to specific CXs or needing to tap 2. For us, the demerit is that the vanilla T-rex has to be on the field in order to perform the brainstorm. 

Experienced players would already know how broken brainstorm 6 is - one stock can convert to 50% more resources, 50% more mill, and much lower variance on missing brainstorm and being sad and broke and lonely. Btw the styracosaurus brainstorm also bonds to the vanilla T-rex allowing us to search for it from deck, so we'll always meet the condition to use the brainstorm. As a cherry on top, this effect also serves as a ditch-out or hand filter for an early body.

### The Events
As mentioned earlier, this deck needs to play a lot of events so that we can take advantage of being able to plus 2 off the lv1 combo. In total my build plays 15 events which feels like a sweet-spot, but feel free to play more or less depending on how greedy you feel.

[![Lv1 Forky Event](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_092.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-092) *Check 3 add 1.* [![Lv1 Bullseye Event](./cards/webp/pxr_s94_t09.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S94-T09) *Brainstorm 3, salvage lvl equal to characters milled.* 

Forky is a Torch profile that can add events, however it can only check 3 cards.

Bullseye is a Tornado profile which makes it very easy to loop combo or add 0s.

Deckspeed good. 

[![Lv2 Duke Caboom Event](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_095.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-095) *Pay 1 to check 3 add 2, or salvage a gate.*

Slamming a CX every turn is how we keep generating an unfair amount of resources, and this event helps enable that. It also functions as emergency mill or stock-out, and it can add events to hand.

[![Lv2 Bully Event](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_064.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-064) *Pay 1 sac 1, send 1 opponent's character to memory.*

I love it when cards are flavorful in Weiss, I'm bullying my opponent and making sure they can't play with their toys. Your brainstorms and powerful backrows are going to memory. Your early plays and standbys? In memory. Uninteractive finishers like these cool new anti-burns or counters? Goodbye. 

*"But it's so expensive - 2 hand and 1 stock can't be worth it"*

Lucky for me, this deck generates up to 6 stock 3 hand a turn + whatever the brainstorm 6 hits. While other decks prefer to save resources for an explosive finisher, heal down, or on the rare occasion go all out at lv2, this deck instead makes the rest of the game miserable for the opponent.

[![Lv2 Ratatouille Event](./cards/webp/pxr_s94_024.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S94-024) *Pay 3 stockswap, salvage 1.*

Last but not least, having to access to stockswap before lv3 is always a treat. Yes it's not [buns](https://en.ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=BD/W54-E065) but our opponent must always respect the stockswap, we also generate enough stock to be able to afford it easily. The bonus of salvage on play makes it hand neutral and can grab a finisher when going for game or loop combo at lv2. This deck plays the yellow event from the previous set, but the same profile also got reprinted in red. Playing the yellow event here is important since we need the color for our level 1 tornado event.

### The Finisher - Buzz & Jessie
[![Lv3 Buzz & Jessie Finisher](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_039.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-039) *On play check 3 add 1. On attack pitch 2, mill opponent's bottom 4, burn x+2 for every lv0 milled.*

At first glance this isn't a very exciting finisher, but upon a closer look it comes with many perks. The on-play effect means that we'll always find our CX or dig for a stockswap or bully event. Icytail-type finishers is famous for being able to ignore the opponent's compression. Interestingly, Buzz & Jessie also guarantees at least a burn 2 despite being an icytail finisher so we will always have reach even if no CXs are milled, such as against a stockswapped deck with few CXs. Overall, it is just a flexible and efficient finisher that works into any deckstate.

### The Lv0s
[![Lv0 Buzz & Woody Riki](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_069.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-069) *On play or on waiting room, pay 1 clock top deck, check 5 add 1.*
 
One of the most amazing riki profile so far, there are two separate trigger timings and this card can mill up to 10 cards on its own. We can also add events off the effect. Incredible design by Bushiroad.

[![Lv0 Sheep](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_087.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-087) *Reverse opponent to pay 1, check 2, opponent picks one to add to hand.*

This is a solid beater that also provides some hand advantage and milling. Our sheep can grow quite large (+1k per opponent’s character), allowing us to beat most level 1 combos if we can’t field triple ourselves.

[![Lv0 Mater Riko](./cards/webp/pxr_s94_t44s.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S94-T44S) *Ditch to top-check, salvage lvl shown.* [![Lv0 Mike Double Filter](./cards/webp/pxr_s94_t24.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S94-T24) *Ditch CX salvage. 2 or more draw ditch.*

Mater is a Riko profile, mainly used to loop brainstorms or filter for level 0s. Our chances of revealing a level 1 is roughly 50/50 in this deck, so it can also be used as a way to loop combo.

Mike Wazowski is a very nice double filter that also offers some draw. We will be triggering bars so having the ability to grab a specific character from waiting room would come up often. I always like to salvage this off combo if able.

[![Lv0 Woody Cx Swap](./cards/webp/pxr_s94_t02.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S94-T02) *CX swap. Check 2 rearrange.* [![Lv0 Luca Cantrip](./cards/webp/pxr_s94_075.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S94-075) *Pay 1 ditch 1, check x. Pay 2 freefresh.*

Woody is just a basic CX swap, but the ability to check 2 rearrange can set up hits for our lv1 combo.

Luca allows us to dig for a gate because slamming a CX every turn is how you win in Weiss. The ability to pay 2 to freefresh can sometimes come up but very rarely since our lv1 combo requires a waiting room.

### The early-plays
[![Lv3 Woody & Friends](./cards/webp/pxr_s94_003.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S94-003) *4+ ep heal to stock.* [![Lv3 Ducky & Bunny](./cards/webp/pxr_s122_091.webp)](https://ws-tcg.com/cardlist/?cardno=PXR/S122-091) *6+ events ep heal.*

Pretty basic ep-healers here. Woody & Friends is the easier to use ep healer but sometimes it can be hard to meet color condition. Ducky & Bunny is on red so we won't miss color, but its ep condition can be trickier to use. 

#### And that is all the cards for the deck!
