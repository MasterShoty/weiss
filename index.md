## Deck Lists

### [Pixar Events](./decklists/pixarevents)
An event heavy deck that focuses on generating infinite resources with brainstorm 6 and combo that pluses 2, into hindering the opponent's gameplan by sending their cards to memory, and finally ending with a cheap icytail finisher.

### Saekano 8 Bar (Coming Soon)
Pet deck for pet series. Cheat stock & slam cx every turn, build memory compression, set up an expensive finisher that doesn't kill.
