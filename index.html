    <a>An event heavy deck that focuses on generating infinite resources with brainstorm 6 and combo that pluses 2, into hindering the opponent's gameplan by sending their cards to memory, and finally ending with a cheap icytail finisher.</a>
    <h3><a>Saekano 8 Bar (Coming Soon)</a></h3>
    <a>Pet deck for pet series. Cheat stock & slam cx every turn, build memory compression, set up an expensive finisher that doesn't kill.</a>
